****** GAMEPLAY ********

* Why this style of movement?
    - This type of movement allows user to perform actions whilst they are moving. (Action here style).
    - Hack things whilst running creates opportunities for timeing things in the environment with the players movement.
        - Open a door just as the player reaches it and close it again.
        - Activate a trap whilst someone is chasing you.

* Can "hack" things whilst running around. (Some things require the agent to be close to the thing before it can be hacked)
    - Time doors opening
    - Turn lights on and off
    - Open air locks
    - Re-route patrol robots. (this could be an entire gameplay mechanic)
    - Open jail cells. 
    - Open armoury (may require mini game to unlock)

* How??
    Open gadget display
    - Shows whatever is selected e.g. doors, robots
    - These things can be clicked to hack now. If they were clickable all the time it would be hard to 
        move around.

* Curse of monkey island gameplay
    - Pick things up in the environment.
    - Use themn to solve puzzles. e.g. Use a breathings mask and fill a room up with water to drown guards.
    - Combine them to make new things.
